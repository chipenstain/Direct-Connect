## Description
Direct-Conect (**DC**) - open source web chatting, voice &amp; video calling app.\
\
The main feature of DC is a direct connection between subscribers, bypassing the server.\
The server is used only as an address book that stores the IP addresses of subscribers for making a call.\
But there is also the opportunity to work without it at all, you just need to know the public IP address of the subscriber who is going to make a call.
